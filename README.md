## Things that went well

I think my code looks clean.  
I think I used functions well
It works!!

## Challenges

It took me a bit of time to figure out how to structure this. Wrapping my head over having two players with different scores took me a bit of time. I wrote down what I did know and eventually it clicked as I went along

I think there is probably a better way to the if statements. I did a lot of if checks and I reckon there is a way to half them.
